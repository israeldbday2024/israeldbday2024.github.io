                <em>A Reader's Digest of GQL</em>
                <div class="collapse"><br>GQL (Graph Query Language) is being developed as a new ISO standard for graph query languages to play the same role for graph databases as SQL plays for relational. In parallel, an extension of SQL for querying property graphs, SQL/PGQ, is added to the SQL standard; it shares the graph pattern matching functionality with GQL. Both standards (not yet published) are hard-to-understand specifications of hundreds of pages. The goal is to present a digest of the language that is easy for the research community to understand, and thus to initiate research on these future standards for querying graphs. The focus will be on pattern matching features shared by GQL and SQL/PGQ, as well as querying facilities of GQL.<br><br></div>
                <div class="collapse">Wim Martens is interested in foundational aspects of data management (with a current focus on graph databases and information extraction), logic, complexity, and formal language theory.He was invited speaker at PODS and STOC, and his research received several awards (e.g., two ACM SIGMOD research highlight awards, an ICDT best paper award, and an ICDT test-of-time award). He acted as program committee member in major conferences in databases, the Web, theoretical computer science, and logic, such as SIGMOD, PODS, ICDE, ICDT, WWW, ICALP, STACS, and LICS.</div>
