		                <em>Actually, data is a rivalrous good</em>
		                <div class="collapse"><br>There is a tendency in many fields, including computer science, economics, and industry, to model data as a non-rival good---this is econ-speak for the property that one entity using a particular piece of data doesn't impinge on its use by others. Food is a classic rival good (if I eat the apple, you cannot); digital music is a classic non-rival good (my listening to the song has no effect on your listening experience). Data might, at first blush, seem more like digital music than like an apple. In this talk, I will give arguments from three fields---economics, privacy, and statistics---for why modeling data as non-rival is problematic, and will argue that we need a new paradigm.<br><br></div>
		                <div class="collapse">Prof. Katrina Ligett is faculty in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Hebrew University, where she is also the academic director of the interdisciplinary Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality, an affiliated faculty member and former head of the MATAR program on the Interfaces of Technology, Society, and Networks (formerly known as Internet & Society), and an affiliate of the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center. Before joining Hebrew University, she was faculty in computer science and economics at Caltech. Katrina's primary research interests are in data privacy, algorithmic fairness, machine learning theory, and algorithmic game theory. She received her PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2009 and did her postdoc at Cornell University.</div>

		                <div class="collapse">Prof. Jeffrey Ullman is the Stanford W. Ascherman Professor of Engineering, Emeritus, at Stanford University. He is a world-renowned researcher in the field of computer science, focusing his research on algorithms, programming languages, and database systems. Prof. Ullman began his academic career studying engineering mathematics at Columbia University and earned his PhD in electrical engineering from Princeton University. Over the course of his career, Prof. Ullman published hundreds of peer-reviewed journal and conference articles, in addition to authoring a large number of widely used books. He has sat on a large number of technical and scientific advisory boards, editorial boards, and boards of directors, sharing his expertise with government agencies, commercial companies, and start-ups.In addition, he has served on committees at academic institutions across the United States and in Singapore, Italy, Japan, and Israel. In recognition of his academic achievements, Prof. Ullman has received numerous prestigious prizes, including the Donald E. Knuth Prize, the SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award, the SIGMOD Test-of-Time Award, and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. In 2020, the Association of Computing Machinery bestowed upon Prof. Ullman the <strong>A.M. Turing Award, which is considered akin to the Nobel Prize</strong>.</div>
